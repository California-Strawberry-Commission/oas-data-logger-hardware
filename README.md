## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains all hardware design files, schematics, PCB layouts, and component datasheets for the **Agricultural Data Logger**. This device is engineered for robust, in-field use on agricultural vehicles (such as tractors and spray rigs), offering a common, fast, and reliable method for data collection from various sensors.

The system continuously gathers high-frequency sensor data, including high-precision GPS location, stores it locally on a microSD card, and uploads the data to a cloud server via Wi-Fi whenever a connection is available.

The hardware design prioritizes low-power operation, high-speed data throughput, and resilience in harsh vehicular environments.

## 4. Power System Architecture

The power system is engineered for robustness and efficiency:

* **Primary Power Source:** Accepts 10-14V DC input from a vehicle auxiliary power outlet. A DC-DC buck converter regulates this down to 3.3V.
* **Input Protection:** Includes filtering and transient voltage suppression to protect electronics from vehicular electrical noise.
* **Low-Power Domain:** ESP32-S3 enters deep sleep mode to maximize battery life. Peripherals (GPS, microSD) are switched via TPS22918, reducing sleep current to microamps.
* **Peak Current:** Designed for a peak current draw of \~150mA, supporting simultaneous GPS acquisition and microSD card operations.

## 5. Design Evolution & Rationale

This hardware revision represents significant evolution from previous prototypes:

* **MCU Change (ItsyBitsy/PICO-ZERO → ESP32-S3-MINI-1):** Eliminated the need for risky, irreversible eFuse programming by selecting a chip with dedicated SDIO pins.
* **Storage Interface (SPI → SDIO):** Upgraded storage interface from SPI to SDIO to accommodate higher frequency data logging without bottlenecks.
* **GPS Module (Previous → SAM-M10Q):** Chosen for superior sensitivity, multiple constellation support, and low-power performance suitable for challenging field environments.
